        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I’m Guillermo Bereche and I’m enrolled in the <em><strong>Interactive Media Design Program</strong></em> in the 1<sup>st</sup> semester. I was born in Peru and I just got to Canada the last winter. This is my second experience in post secondary studies since I was studying <em><strong>Music</strong></em> in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">PUCP</abbr>, which is a university in my country, but I dropped because my family had to move here.</p>
        <p>Despite I was studying <em><strong>Music</strong></em>, I was ever interested in the other aspects of Art, especially those related to technology. Although I don’t have a vast experience in design or web development, I liked and was average good in Tech classes and I ever was curious how to combine the virtual world with the art world.</p>
        <p>I would like to share a quote that I like, which is:</p> 
            <blockquote>Hard work betrays none, but dreams betray many. working hard alone doesn't assure you that you'll achieve your dreams. Actually, there are more cases where you don't. Even so, working hard and achieving something is some consolation at least.<cite>- Hikigaya Hachiman</cite></blockquote></p>
